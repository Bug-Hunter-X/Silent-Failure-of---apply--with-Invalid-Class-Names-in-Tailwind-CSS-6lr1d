To solve this, ensure that all class names used with `@apply` are defined in your Tailwind configuration or imported correctly.  Thoroughly check your spelling and make use of your IDE's autocompletion features to minimize the risk of typos.

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 p-4">This div has the expected styles applied.</div>
```

Here's a better example demonstrating correct usage.  Note that you should use classes that are actually part of your Tailwind configuration.

Using a linter or a strict CSS-in-JS framework helps catch this sort of error early. 

Also, consider using PurgeCSS or another CSS optimization tool to remove unused styles from your final CSS output. This helps reduce the potential for using non-existent classes accidentally.
