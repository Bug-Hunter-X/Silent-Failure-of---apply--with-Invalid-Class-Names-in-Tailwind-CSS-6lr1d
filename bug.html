This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with the `@apply` directive and an invalid class name is applied to an element.  For example:

```html
<div class="@apply invalid-class"></div>
```

Tailwind will not throw an error during compilation, but the `invalid-class` won't be applied, and your styles will be incorrect.  This can be difficult to debug because there's no clear error message.
